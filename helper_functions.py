1) X AND Y SET CREATORS

---> x set creator (X_set)
Takes as input the path and a transformation the number of points and the noise percentage. The outputs are five:the first is the concatenated amplitude of all three sensors
the second,third and fourth are the amplitudes of the second,third and fourth sensor, the fifth is the frequency 


---> y set creator (classification and regression) (y_set)
Takes as input the path. The output is a dataframe containing columns with elements of each sample. These elements are: damage percentage as 'dmg',
the filename as 'damage_file_name', the case study as 'caseStudey', the kind of defect as 'defect' and the index number as 'dmg_index_number'

4) FEATURE ENGINEERING TECHNIQUES

---> prinicipal component analysis (pca)
The input is the X_train and X_test and this function performs pca. PCA finds linear combinations with the largest variance and creates principal 
components with these combinations. The results are the X_train and X_test that instead of the original data they contain the principal components.

---> kernel principal component analysis (kpca)
The input is the X_train and X_test and this function performs kernel pca. First the data are projected in a feature space according to the choice of the kernel. 
Then PCA finds linear combinations with the largest variance and creates principal components with these combinations. The results are the X_train and X_test that 
instead of the original data they contain the principal components from the feature space they were projected.

---> data mixer (data_mixer)
The input is the X and Y data of one dataset and those of another dataset and the percentage that is kept from each dataset
Then the percentages of each dataset are combined and shuffled
The output is the shuffled combination of the two datasets.
